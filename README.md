# Pebble Vote

This is a project for a mobile client that interacts with the [E-cclesia e-voting protocol](https://www.pebble.vote/). The client is developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [BLoC](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) as the state management.

## State of project

At the moment, the UI is not connected with the backend. To connect it, you should understand how to use BLoC because it is the state management that has been setup. Currently dummy data is being populated in the UI.

## Developer notes

1. Dummy data can be found in the respective model dart files, `lib/data/models`.
2. This project uses `app_router` for routes.
